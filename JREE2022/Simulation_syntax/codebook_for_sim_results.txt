Codebook for simulation results:

NG: number of groups (clusters).
GS: group size (number of observations per cluster).
cv: coefficient of variation (0 = balanced clusters). This is constant (.25) in the main simulation.
inter: controls the base prevalence rate (of the intercept).
beta: effect size of the coefficients (set to a constant of .3 in the simulation).
iccsd: varies the intraclass correlation coefficient.
nonc_glm: how many glms did not converge properly/provide admissable results.
nonc_glmm: how many glmms did not converge properly/provide admissable results.
reps: how many replications for each condition.

columns names with:

- sebias: refers to the standard error bias.
- cr2: for the cr2 (Bell and McCaffrey) estimator.
- ml: when maximum likelihood is used for the glmm (not shown in the simulation results).
- reml: when restricted maximum likelihood is used for the glmm.
- cr0: for the cr0 (Liang and Zeger) estimator.
- b0 to b4: refers to the corresponding regression coefficients (starting with the intercept b0).

- power: refers to the empirical rejection rates (using alpha = .05).
- bm: Bell and McCaffrey empirical degrees of freedom.
- bw: between-within degrees of freedom.

- cp: refers to coverage probabilities.
- time: how long the condition took to complete the number of reps.
- T00: Mean of Tau00 for the glmm.
